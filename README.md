Hi I am **Kyle M**, I'm based in Northern Virginia just outside of Washington, D.C., recently changed jobs to DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer dealing with some R&D environments. Working on both the physical aspect of the hardware servers, network and the code to manage it all - my code sucks though so please hold tight as I continue to learn.
