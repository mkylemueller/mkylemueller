Hi I am **Kyle M**, I'm an Infrastructure Engineer here at GitHub! I'm based in Northern Virginia just outside of Washington, D.C. where I work between the ground and up to the cloud building data centers. Working on both the physical aspect of the hardware servers, network and the code to manage it all - my code sucks though so please hold tight as I continue to learn. 

### üß∞ My Workspace 

I have the honor to work from home (pre-covid) heres some details on the setup in the home office!
